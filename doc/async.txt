    async def
        This creates a coroutine function, it is a function that returns a coroutine object

    Coroutines
        These are implementing leveraging the 'yield' capabilities (the stop the function and resume
        later thing)

    Tasks
        Tasks are coroutines (the object, not coroutine functions)
        Coroutines tied to an event loop
        "asyncio.create_task()"
